Neo is an open-source community-driven blockchain platform. The main products
you can find here are Neo blockchain node, developer tools and documentation.
PRs and issues are welcome in every repository.

# Node

You can get the node from the [neo](https://github.com/neo-project/neo) repository.
Take a look at [neo-modules](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-modules) as well,
because it contains many useful plugins for it (like RPC server that is not a
part of the default node).

# Developer tools

To develop smart contracts for Neo in C# you need
[neo-devpack-dotnet](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-devpack-dotnet).
[neo-debugger](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-debugger) can be used to
debug contracts written in any language. See also:
* [neo-express](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express)
  * [neo3-visual-tracker](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express/tree/master/extentions/neo3-visual-tracker)
  * [neo-blockchain-toolkit](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express/tree/master/src/bctklib)
* [RpcClient](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-modules/tree/master/src/RpcClient)

# Documentation and websites

[proposals](https://github.com/neo-project/proposals) is where Neo standards
(aka Neo Enhancement Proposals or NEPs) are maintained. These are the ultimate
reference for protocol operation and inter-component interfaces. They're however
a bit more formal and we recommend starting from documentation below for
beginners.

[docs](https://github.com/neo-project/docs) is what drives
[docs.neo.org](https://docs.neo.org), the reference source of documentation on
concepts and system APIs. [neo-dev-portal](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-dev-portal)
is the repository behind [developers.neo.org](https://developers.neo.org/) which
covers more diverse spectrum of tools and provides more complete integration
examples.

[neo.org](https://github.com/neo-project/neo.org) is about [neo.org](https://neo.org)
contents, if you've spotted a typo there you're welcome to submit issue/PR.

# Special ones

[non-native-contracts](https://github.com/neo-project/non-native-contracts/)
contains some well-known contracts (like NNS) deployed to both testnet and
mainnet and useful for general audience.
